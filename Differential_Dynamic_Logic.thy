  We present a formalization of a uniform substitution calculus for
  differential dynamic logic (dL). In this calculus, the soundness of dL
  proofs is reduced to the soundness of a finite number of axioms, standard
  propositional rules and a central \textit{uniform substitution} rule for
  combining axioms. We present a formal definition for the denotational
  semantics of dL and prove the uniform substitution calculus sound by showing
  that all inference rules are sound with respect to the denotational
  semantics, and all axioms valid (true in every state and interpretation).

  dynamic logic. In Amy P. Felty and Aart Middeldorp, editors, International
