# Formalization of  Differential Dynamic Logic

This formalization defines a deep embedding of differential dynamic logic and proves it sound.
We support a significant fragment of operations supported in the KeYmaera X theorem prover,
and non-trivial proofs can be exported from KeYmaera X and rechecked with the formalized system.
The formalization also provides an alternative (computable) integer interval semantics for dL
and a soundness theorem with respect to the standard semantics.

This repository contains the most recent (and therefore least stable) changes.
At times, it may only check with development versions of Isabelle.
For a more stable but less developed copy, see:
