Formalization of differential dynamic logic in Isabelle/HOL

Requirements:

Isabelle/HOL development version:
  http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/
  http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/cadd40a6cdec/README_REPOSITORY

Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP) development version:
  https://bitbucket.org/isa-afp/afp-devel/

This formalization relies primarily on the formalization of ordinary
differential equations given in the (development) AFP, which differs from 
that in published work. This in turn depends on the development version of
Isabelle.
